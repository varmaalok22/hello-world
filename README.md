This is a trial repository to get to know how to use GitHub

Hello, world. I am trying to understand how GitHub works better, in order to have better version control on all my codes, and in the spirit of open access. I know it seems a little bit late to be doing this, but hey, better late than never, I always say!

Cheers,
Aalok.
